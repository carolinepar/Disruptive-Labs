                <p>

                Disruptive Labs is a service that provides Do-It-Yourself (DIY) homeschooling kits through delivery kits. 
                Homeschool programs allow students to learn scholarly subjects at the studentâ€™s home instead of learning at school. 
                These homeschool programs are generally taught by online teachers, teachers, or a family member. 
                However, those whom are homeschooled do not capture the full experience that directly learning from a school provides. 
                Learning from a school provides one-on-one experience with a professional, learning at a consistent pace, and focusing on the direct subject. 
                Being homeschooled may lead to an inconsistent pace, steering away from the subject, and not learning from a professional.
                <br/><br/>

                What Disruptive Labs attempts to accomplish is to create the same experience that going to school provides. 
                Besides the aforementioned learning experience, Disruptive Labs will utilize weekly delivery kits to create a consistent pace, 
                with access to online tutoring for direct professional experience, and multiple subjects from the average level sciences 
                to the AP classes for the rigorous exams at the end of the semester.
