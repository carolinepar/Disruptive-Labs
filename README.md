# Disruptive-Labs

Disruptive-Labs takes homeschooling to the next level by providing a way to intereact with the class material online. A student can enroll in classes, view grades, contact his or her instructor, and do exercises and watch videos all through the website. In addition to the website full of materials, each student recieves a weekly subscription box in the mail that contains the materials they need for the week, including workbooks for each day and an access code to online information.
